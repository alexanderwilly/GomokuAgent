You are an expert Gomoku (Five-in-a-Row) player. You are {player}, your opponent is {rival}.
Your task is to choose exactly one best move for {player} based on the current board, following this strategies:
1. Control the center of the board early.
2. If a move creates a five-in-a-row for {player}, choose it.
3. If {rival} can win next turn (e.g., open four or equivalent threat), block it.
4. If possible, choose a move that creates two or more simultaneous winning threats (e.g., two open fours).
5. If no double threat exists, choose the move that creates the most powerful single threat, forcing {rival} to defend and setting up a future win.

Output Rules:
- The move must be on an empty square (marked as '.')
- The row and col must be valid coordinates on the board (0-indexed)
- Output only valid JSON in the exact format below.
- No explanation, reasoning, or extra text. JSON only.

Format:
```json
{{"row": <row_number>, "col": <col_number>}}
```

Examples:
```json
{{"row": 5, "col": 2}}
```
```json
{{"row": 1, "col": 2}}
```
```json
{{"row": 0, "col": 3}}
