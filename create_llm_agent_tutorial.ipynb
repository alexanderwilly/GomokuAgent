    "1. **Agent Architecture** - How to inherit from base classes and implement required methods\n",
    "2. **Game State Analysis** - How to read and interpret game information\n",
    "3. **Strategic Reasoning** - How to implement win detection, blocking, and strategic positioning\n",
    "4. **LLM Integration** - How LLMs can be used for game AI (with mock implementation)\n",

    "### Key Design Patterns\n",
    "- **Strategy Pattern**: Different agents implement different strategies\n",
    "- **Template Method**: Base class defines structure, subclasses implement specifics  \n",
    "- **Dependency Injection**: Arena accepts any agent that follows the interface\n",
    "- **Fallback Pattern**: Always have a backup plan when AI fails\n",
